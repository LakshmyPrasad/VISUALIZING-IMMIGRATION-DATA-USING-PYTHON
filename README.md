# VISUALIZING-IMMIGRATION-DATA-USING-PYTHON
The project represents immigration data visually using python libraries. The initial steps include applying data exploration and data cleaning techniques to make the data analysis ready. Python's matplotlib library has been primarily used to depict some basic and specialized visualization. Apart from it, the case study also includes libraries such as seaborn for regression plots and folium for creating maps and geospatial data.
